# Using-Regression-Analysis-to-Build-the-Best-Model-Based-on-a-Paper-by-Caspi-et-al
In "Influence of Life Stress on Depression: Moderation by a Polymorphism in the 5-HTT Gene" by Caspi et al, the authors explored interactions between genes and environmental factors in determining causes of depression. The authors found that there was a statistically significant relation between genetics and depression as well as interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Other authors, namely Risch et al. in the paper "Interaction Between the Serotonin Transporter Gene (5-HTTLPR), Stressful Life Events, and Risk of Depression: A Meta-analysis," determined that Caspi et al made a Type I Error in their analysis. That is, they wrongly rejected the null hypothesis. i.e. a false positive. In my study, I have determined the best model for depression based on genetic and environmental factors from randomly generated data based on the paper which was provided to me. My conclusion is that, based on the given data, only environmental impacts were significant in causing depression in individuals. My methods included data cleaning and merging, advanced imputation on missing values using the EM Algorithm, multiple regression, and stepwise selection in both directions.
